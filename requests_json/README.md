# Request JSON with `requests`

Sometimes you just need go get some API content in a dictionary


## Execution

```shell
$ python call_api.py
```

## Explanation

`requests` is a [useful and simple way](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/) to get a response from a web server. Using it's `raise_for_status` and `json()` functionality in a helper method, we can easily call URLs and get their contents in workable objects.
